Thanks to [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/WebDevSimplified) for making [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/rymG9UmPuhM) on how to make this extension. I obviously added some more touches from his tutorial.

# How to add it as a chrome extension?:
1. Download the source code
2. Extract it from the ZIP file to a folder, on your local drive.
3. Go to the Chrome Extensions page (chrome://extensions)
4. Tap load unpacked extension
5. Select the folder where you downloaded the source code to
6. Tap the extension, to see if it works

NOTE: You can also pin the extension if you like, but you won't be able to see anything. 

And boom, your done.
